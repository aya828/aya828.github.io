            <p>
                I was born in New Jersey and raised both in NJ and Tokyo, Japan.
                I studied Journalism for undergrad at Brooklyn College and earned a Bachelor’s degree.
                I then started working retail at Apple then transitioned into technical support at Apple, where my
                interest grew for technology.
                I knew I wanted to pursue a career in technology and started on my Master’s degree at Marymount
                University
                for Cybersecurity and moved to Alexandria, VA, with my Yorki-poo, Baxter.

                While attending school, I became a Systems Administrator and soon found that a
                Systems Administrator was not something I wanted to be.
                I found the GWU Coding Bootcamp online and decided to take this step towards becoming a web developer!
